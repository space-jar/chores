Without an http server, module imports were throwing cors errors.


I have my webpage execute JS by including the file I want to run (main.js) in a script tag. (I guess this is what is referred to as the "entry point").
Without bundling (done by webpack), all JS modules included by main.js would also need their own script tags in the html files. This is the only way the browser would know to go looking for them.
BUT, with bundling, I can designate my entry point (main.js) and the bundling application will find all of its includes/dependencies and their includes and dependencies and "BUNDLE" them all up into a single file,
so that only the single script tag include is necessary.

I asked ChatGPT to review this description. It approved, but gave me some refinements:

Yes, your description of a JavaScript module bundler like Webpack is mostly accurate. Hereâ€™s a refined version of your explanation:

### Without Bundling

1. **Multiple Script Tags**: Without bundling, each JavaScript module needs to be included individually in the HTML file using multiple `<script>` tags. For example:
   
   ```html
   <script src="module1.js"></script>
   <script src="module2.js"></script>
   <script src="main.js"></script>
   ```

2. **Manual Dependency Management**: The browser needs to be aware of the order in which scripts are loaded because the dependencies must be correctly managed. Each module needs to be loaded in the right order to ensure that dependencies are resolved correctly.

### With Bundling (Using Webpack)

1. **Single Entry Point**: You designate a single entry point (e.g., `main.js`) in your Webpack configuration. This is the starting point where Webpack begins analyzing the module dependencies.

2. **Automatic Dependency Resolution**: Webpack traverses the dependency graph, starting from the entry point. It automatically includes all dependencies, sub-dependencies, and their associated modules.

3. **Single Bundle Output**: Webpack bundles all the modules into a single (or multiple, if configured) JavaScript file(s). This means you only need to include one `<script>` tag in your HTML to load the bundled file:

   ```html
   <script src="bundle.js"></script>
   ```

4. **Optimizations**: Webpack can also perform various optimizations, such as minification, code splitting, and asset management (e.g., images, styles), to improve performance and manage resources more effectively.

### Example Workflow with Webpack

1. **Configuration**: You create a Webpack configuration file (`webpack.config.js`) that specifies the entry point and output settings.

   ```javascript
   // webpack.config.js
   const path = require('path');

   module.exports = {
     entry: './src/main.js', // Entry point
     output: {
       filename: 'bundle.js', // Output bundle file
       path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'), // Output directory
     },
     mode: 'development', // or 'production'
   };
   ```

2. **Building**: Run Webpack to create the bundle:

   ```bash
   npx webpack
   ```

3. **Include in HTML**: Use the bundled file in your HTML:

   ```html
   <script src="dist/bundle.js"></script>
   ```

### Summary

- **Without Bundling**: You manually include each script file and manage dependencies yourself.
- **With Bundling**: You use Webpack to automatically handle dependencies, optimize the output, and simplify script inclusion to a single file.

This approach with bundling not only simplifies the HTML but also improves the manageability of complex projects with many modules.
